#Research Interests in Bayesian Statistics

My research interests are in developing statistical models to address customer relationship management/ customer analytics problems in marketing/retailing. Many of these models require Bayesian methods for estimating models with random intercepts with customer heterogeneity. Some of the Bayesian estimation methods typically used in Marketing are Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods using Gibbs Sampler or Metropolis Hastings algorithms, hierarchical Bayes' methods and the like. As I sift through various Marketing papers, I always stumble upon the estimation methods section as these methods seem to be some fancy terminologies of which I am not aware of.  
Though I have a very naive understanding of Bayesian statistics, my objective from this course is to understand the subject in greater depth, be acquainted and eventually master the use of softwares required in estimating Bayesian models and by the end of the summer be proficient in using Bayesian estimation techniques in my second year summer paper.  
My second year summer paper is aimed at understanding how  the varying patterns of cross-buying from a multi-category seller impacts the customer relationship dynamics with the firm. I propose to study this in context of a Hidden Markov Model where the relationship states of the customer with the firm are hidden/latent. The underlying base model is a multivariate logit model with the latent utility function containing random customer specific intercepts. Similar work in the literature has been estimated using Bayesian algorithms aforementioned in the essay.
